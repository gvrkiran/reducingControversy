# controversy-demo

Code for the WWW 2017 demo.

# About the demo
The contribution of this demonstration is twofold: (i) a tool to visualize retweet networks about controversial issues on Twitter. Using our visualization, users can understand how polarized discussions are shaped on Twitter, and explore the positions of the various actors. (ii) Present a solution to reduce polarization of such discussions. We do so by exposing users to information which presents a contrarian point of view. Users can visually inspect our recommendations and understand why and how these would play out in terms of the retweet network.
